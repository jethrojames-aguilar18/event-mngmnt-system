## Overview
This Event Management System provides features that allow event organizers to manage all aspects of an event, including creating event schedules, tracking registrations, managing attendees, and generating reports. The system is built to streamline communication, improve event efficiency, and enhance the overall event experience. This system caters to Polytechnic University of the Philippines' faculty and students to organize campus and off-campus events.

### Key Features:
- **Event Creation and Scheduling**: Organizers can create events with detailed descriptions, set dates, times, venues, and categorize events (corporate, social, cultural, etc.).
- **Registration Management**: Attendees can register for events online, and organizers can track and manage registrations in real-time.
- **Attendee Tracking**: The system tracks attendee details and participation, providing an organized list for reference and follow-up.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Organizers can generate reports on event attendance, participation trends, and other statistics to improve future event planning.
- **Event and Participation Cancellation**: Both event creator and participants can cancel their paticipation on that event and cancel if necessary.

## Technology Stack
To  implement this system, we used a combination of these funcionalities to make the program work:
1. Java Swing - Using Graphical User Interface (GUI), we were able to create both the front-end and back-end of this system using Java Programming Language
2. PhpMyAdmin - Our program database which helps us store and retrieve personal and event informations provided by the user.
3. NetBeans - We used this IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create our system. We used Java with ANT as our tool and used Java Sdk 21 as our java kit.
